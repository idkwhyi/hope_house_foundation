      # Harapan Bagi Bangsa (HBB) Christian Schools
      
      Indonesia Hope House Foundation (YRPI) was founded with a very noble mission to provide affordable quality education for underprivileged children, and to guide them to know Christian values. Through the Harapan Bagi Bangsa (HBB) or Hope For The Nation education program, YRPI not only provides formal education but also strives to build the character and spirituality of every student it educates. With the belief that every child has the potential to become a hope for the nation, YRPI works hard to provide a safe and supportive learning environment.

      ## Sekolah HBB: Affordable Quality Education
      The Harapan Bagi Bangsa Program has established four schools in Jakarta and eight schools in North Sumatra. Through these schools, YRPI provides education at a very low cost, often helping students who are truly unable to continue their education without being charged. With a high commitment, HBB schools adhere to government education standards, so that students have an equal opportunity to achieve quality education. Here, students are not only taught general knowledge, but also moral values ​​and faith, so that in the future they can become individuals who bring hope to the nation.

      ## Why Education Matters: Guiding the Young Generation Towards a Bright Future
      At YRPI, we believe that education is a window to a better future. By providing access to education for underprivileged children, YRPI seeks to open up opportunities for them to escape the cycle of poverty and face the future with optimism. Through education, HBB hopes to produce a generation of young people who are ready to be witnesses of Christ in their daily lives and bring positive change wherever they are. This vision underlies the programs at HBB schools, where every student is taught to know God, learn about the values ​​of love and care, and take responsibility for their future.

      ## The Challenge Behind Our Mission: Reaching Hundreds of Children from Diverse Backgrounds
      Accomplishing this mission is certainly not easy. YRPI and HBB schools face a huge challenge in mentoring hundreds of young people who come from various social and economic backgrounds. Each student has a different story, struggle, and needs. They need not only formal education, but also guidance that helps them grow emotionally and spiritually. This challenge does not discourage YRPI, but rather strengthens its determination to continue this mission with full commitment and love.

      ## How You Can Get Involved: Support for a Better Future
      As a reader, you have the opportunity to be a part of this incredible journey. Your support, whether in the form of prayers or donations, will mean a lot to the continuity and development of the HBB program. With every contribution, you help open doors of opportunity for children in need and give them hope for a brighter future. Your donation will be used for educational needs, school facilities, and basic needs that support student welfare.

      YRPI's mission through the Harapan Bagi Bangsa program is more than just providing education. It is about providing hope, empowering the younger generation, and preparing them to become future leaders. Let's support this journey together, and make your contribution a part of the positive change that benefits many children in Indonesia.

      Be a part of this mission – together we can provide hope and a better future for those in need.

      # Character Building School (CBS)
      **Building Character: The Need for Integrity in Today's World**  

      In today's world, character seems to be in short supply, both nationally and even within Christian circles. More and more individuals, including Christians of all ages, are displaying behaviors that contradict the virtues taught by Jesus. As a result, their actions often become a stumbling block, and their testimony of faith fades. This growing disconnect between values and actions has led to a deeper concern: How can we, as a community, uphold the integrity and virtues that we are called to live by?  

      ## The Motivation Behind CBS  
      This pressing need for stronger character and moral excellence is the very reason we founded CBS (Character Building Schools). We believe that nurturing virtuous personalities in children is not just important; it is a must. In a world where character seems to be undermined, we must accelerate our efforts to raise children who exemplify integrity, responsibility, and kindness.  

      ## Cultivating Integrity and Excellence  
      At CBS, we are committed to providing an environment where children can thrive academically and morally. It’s not enough to just educate children in the traditional sense; we aim to build their character and ensure they develop into individuals with strong, virtuous personalities. Our vision is for them to become excellent individuals who will make a positive impact on the world around them, guided by Christian values and integrity.  

      ## Expanding Our Reach  
      Currently, we operate two CBS schools, each serving 80-150 children. We are proud to offer our program to a wide range of students—not just those from our Harapan Bagi Bangsa (HBB) schools, but also children from all backgrounds. Our doors are open to every child, regardless of their background, because we believe in the power of inclusive education to shape a brighter, more compassionate future.  

      ## The Road Ahead: A Call to Action  
      While we are encouraged by the progress we’ve made so far, there’s still much work to be done. Our mission is clear: we need to raise children who embody the values of excellence, integrity, and virtue. To do this, we must continue to expand, reach more children, and accelerate the pace of character building in our schools.  

      We invite you to join us in this mission. Whether through support, prayer, or volunteerism, your involvement can help us ensure that the next generation is equipped with the character and values needed to make a positive, lasting impact on the world. Together, we can build a future where character and integrity stand as the foundation of every child’s life.

      **Providing Hope and Shelter: A Safe Haven for Homeless Children and Adults**

      In a world where many face hardship and adversity, there are those who often feel forgotten—the homeless, runaway children from broken homes, and even adults who have nowhere to turn. These individuals, despite their struggles, deserve a place where they can feel safe, loved, and given the opportunity to rebuild their lives. That’s why we have created a space that not only accommodates homeless children but also opens its doors to unfortunate adults in need.

      ## A Safe Haven for Children in Crisis
      Homeless children and those running away from broken homes face unimaginable challenges. Without a stable environment, they are at risk of falling into cycles of poverty, abuse, and neglect. Our program provides a sanctuary where these children can find refuge, receive the care they need, and access the resources to build a brighter future. We aim to help them overcome their past struggles and create a pathway to healing and success.  

      ## Welcoming Adults in Need
      While our primary focus is on helping children, we also recognize the struggles that many adults face. For individuals who find themselves without shelter, our doors are open. We believe that everyone deserves a second chance, regardless of age or background. By providing support to homeless adults, we not only offer them a place to stay but also empower them to regain their independence and rebuild their lives.  

      ## A Holistic Approach to Healing
      Our mission is not just about providing shelter—it’s about offering a holistic approach to healing and recovery. For both children and adults, we provide not only a roof over their heads but also access to essential services like education, counseling, and job training. Our goal is to help them develop the skills and confidence they need to reintegrate into society and lead fulfilling, productive lives.  

      ## Building a Community of Care
      At the heart of our program is a sense of community. We believe that no one should have to face their struggles alone. Our team, along with volunteers and partners, works together to provide a nurturing, supportive environment where everyone feels valued and cared for. We encourage the growth of strong relationships, personal responsibility, and compassion, creating a foundation for lasting change.  

      ## How You Can Help
      You can play a vital role in making this vision a reality. Whether through donations, volunteering, or simply spreading awareness, your support helps provide essential resources and hope to those in need. Every contribution, no matter how small, brings us closer to creating a world where no one has to face homelessness alone.  

      By offering shelter, love, and practical support, we’re creating a future where every individual, no matter their age or background, has the chance to rebuild and thrive. Join us in making a difference, and together, we can create a brighter future for homeless children and adults in our community.
